# Description

[^mn]: {-} ![](/images/arctic.jpg)

[^mn] In this seminar we provide a topical overview of the syntax of *ellipsis* – the phenomenon whereby linguistic material left unpronounced is nevertheless understood. The plan is to give an empirical overview of a different elliptical construction in each session, with a focus on cutting-edge research. We’ll relate the empirical picture to the  broader question of whether ellipsis involves deletion under identity or anaphora.

# Tentative schedule

 - Day 1: VP ellipsis
 - Day 2 \& 3: sluicing
 - Day 4: NP ellipsis
 - Day 5: gapping
