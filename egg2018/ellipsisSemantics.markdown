# Description

[^mn]: {-} ![](/images/arctic2.jpg)

[^mn] In this seminar, we delve into the semantics of elliptical constructions, by focusing on the interaction between ellipsis and *binding* – a topic that has been the focus of intensive research since Sag’s (1976) pioneering dissertation. In the first part of the class, we will introduce a number of classical ellipsis/binding puzzles, and the debate surrounding their analysis: the strict/sloppy ambiguity, MaxElide, and Dahl’s puzzle. In the second part of the class, we will briefly introduce *dynamic semantics*, and argue that static conceptions of binding are insufficient for analysing certain interactions between binding and ellipsis. Ultimately, we will suggest that once one shifts to a dynamic perspective, ellipsis can itself be analysed as a kind of binding.
