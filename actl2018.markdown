# Description

[^mn]: {-} ![](/images/cyclist.jpg)

[^mn]This course will provide an introduction to the study of linguistic meaning
through the lens of *dynamic semantics* 
- an approach to semantics developed primarily during the 80s by Irene Heim and
Hans Kamp. 
The central claim of dynamic semantics is that the meaning of a sentence
consists of a set of instructions for updating the common ground. 
As such, dynamic semantics emphasises the flow of information over the course of
a discourse, as opposed to concentrating only the meaning of a sentence taken in
isolation.
Starting from some basic building blocks, we'll put together a version of
dynamic semantics, and use it to analyse the behaviour of definites, indefinites
, and pronouns. Time permitting, we'll also discuss the dynamic approach to presuppositions.

Tentative course schedule (allowing for some slippage):

 - session 1: The formal semanticist's toolkit
 - session 2: First order logic
 - session 3: Dynamic predicate logic
 - session 4: Predicate logic with anaphora 
 - session 5: Presupposition

# Background

I'll assume a basic knowledge of set theory and first-order logic in this course. Elizabeth Coppock has put together a useful primer, which you can find online [here](http://eecoppock.info/DynamicSemantics/Lectures/logic-2up.pdf).
