title: About 
...

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Leibniz-Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft](https://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de) in Berlin, associated with the semantics and pragmatics research group. I'm a theoretical linguist, which means that my work involves developing formal models of what we know when we know a language. Mostly, I do semantics, but I'm also interested in syntax, morphology, pragmatics, and their interfaces with semantics. 

When I'm not doing linguistics, I [code](https://github.com/patrl), [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59694544-patrick-elliott), and scale vertical walls. [Here](images/documenta.jpg) is a picture of me at documenta 14 in Kassel.
