I'm a postdoctoral associate in the linguistics & philosophy department at MIT. I'm a theoretical linguist, which means that my work involves
developing formal models of what we know when we know a language. Mostly, I do
semantics, but I'm also interested in syntax, morphology, pragmatics, and their interfaces with semantics.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I [[https://github.com/patrl][code]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59694544-patrick-elliott][read]], and scale vertical walls.
