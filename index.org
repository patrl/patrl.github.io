I'm a visiting faculty member in the linguistics & philosophy department at MIT.
I'm a theoretical linguist, which means that my work involves developing formal models of what we know when we know a language. Mostly, I do semantics, but I'm also interested in syntax, morphology, pragmatics, and their interfaces with semantics.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I [[https://github.com/patrl][code]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59694544-patrick-elliott][read]], and scale vertical walls. Reach me
at ~pdell@mit.edu~, or via [[https://keybase.io/patrl/chat][encrypted chat]].
