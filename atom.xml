    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>If</em>-clauses are weird. They have a couple of prominent uses: as the antecedent clause in a conditional <em>if…then…</em> statement (see (1)), and as an embedded question (<a href="#1">1</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li><span id="1"></span>If Britta is taking this class, then I’m not.</li>
<li><span id="2"></span>Jeff asked if Britta is taking this class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, I’m interested in the latter cases, which I’ll call <em>if</em>-questions. Their distribution is constrained in some interesting ways. Under <em>rogative</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> predicates, <em>if</em>-questions seem, more-or-less, to be in free variation with <em>whether</em>-questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jeff {wondered|asked} {if|whether} Britta is taking this class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Elsewhere however, the similarity between <em>whether</em>-questions and <em>if</em>-questions breaks down. Unlike <em>whether</em>-questions (and interestingly, much like <em>that</em>-clauses), <em>if</em>-questions aren’t permitted as the complement of a preposition.</p>
<ol>
<li>Britta thought about {whether|if|that} she should attend class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, <em>if</em>-questions generally seem pretty bad as subjects, unlike both <em>whether</em>-questions and <em>that</em>-clauses, which are attested, under certain conditions, in this environment.</p>
<ol>
<li>{Whether|*if} Jeff attends depends on whether Britta attends.</li>
<li>That Britta is attending class worries Jeff.</li>
</ol>
<p>These facts are clearly telling us something interesting about the syntactic properties of <em>if</em>-questions vis a vis other varieties of embedded clause, maybe specifically about their case properties. I don’t want to speculate more about this here.</p>
<p>Moving on, <em>if</em>-questions show some extremely interesting behaviour under <em>responsive</em> predicates, such as <em>know</em> and <em>admit</em>. These facts were first uncovered and analysed in a 2001 paper by <span class="citation" data-cites="adger_syntax_2001">Adger &amp; Quer (2001)</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, who claim that <em>if</em>-questions exhibit polarity sensitivity under responsive predicates. The judgements are subtle, but the following contrast is fairly illustrative.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>*?Jeff told me if Britta left.</li>
<li>Jeff didn’t tell me if Britta left.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adger &amp; Quer develop a theory tailored to derive this kind of contrast. I have some issues with their account, but I’ll leave that for another post (maybe!). For the time being I just want to note that the predicate <em>imagine</em> poses an interesting problem for the distribution of <em>if</em>-clauses, and its certainly outside of the scope of Adger &amp; Quer’s account. First, note that <em>imagine</em> doesn’t embed <em>whether</em>-questions at all (<a href="#9">9</a>). The polarity of the matrix clause doesn’t seem to make a difference (<a href="#10">10</a>). However, when the matrix clause is an imperative (<a href="#11">11</a>), or otherwise a request directed at the addressee (<a href="#12">12</a>), an embedded <em>if</em>-question is licensed, despite the fact that an embedded <em>whether</em>-question still isn’t.</p>
<ol>
<li><span id="9"></span>Jeff imagined {whether|if|that} Britta left.</li>
<li><span id="10"></span>Jeff never imagined {whether|if|that} Britta left.</li>
<li><span id="11"></span>Imagine {*whether|if|that} Britta left.</li>
<li><span id="12"></span>Can you imagine {*whether|if|that} Britta left.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adger &amp; Quer of course don’t consider this kind of data, but it’s difficult to see how one could extend their account to this, since as far as I can see, they predict <em>if</em>-questions to be licensed in a subset of the environments that <em>whether</em>-questions are.</p>
<p>Zooming out a bit, how the hell do kids acquire these kinds of subtle distributional facts, given that <em>whether</em>-questions and <em>if</em>-questions seem, roughly, to mean the same thing?</p>
<p>More selectional puzzles soon! And, as always, my deepest apologies to the non-linguists.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p><span class="citation" data-cites="heimThesis">Heim (1982)</span> classifies predicates that embed questions, broadly, as either <em>rogative</em> or <em>responsive</em>. <em>Rogative</em> predicates are those which may embed interrogative clauses, but not declaratives, like <em>wonder</em> and <em>ask</em>. <em>Responsive</em> predicates on the other hand may embed both interrogatives and declaratives, such as <em>know</em> and <em>tell</em>.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn3"><p>This isn’t much discussed much by <span class="citation" data-cites="adger_syntax_2001">Adger &amp; Quer (2001)</span>, but (8a) is almost certainly acceptable under the reading that can be paraphrased as “If Britta left, then Jeff told me (that Britta left)”. I assume that this is a possible analysis of (8a), since <em>tell</em> independently allows Null Complement Anaphora, as in “Britta left. Jeff told me.”<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
