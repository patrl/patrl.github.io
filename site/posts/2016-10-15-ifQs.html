<p><em>If</em>-clauses are weird. They have a couple of prominent uses: as the antecedent clause in a conditional <em>if...then...</em> statement (see (@1)), and as an embedded question (@2).</p>
<p>(@1) If Britta is taking this class, then I'm not. (@2) Jeff asked if Britta is taking this class.</p>
<p>Here, I'm interested in the latter cases, which I'll call <em>if</em>-questions. Their distribution is constrained in some interesting ways. Under <em>rogative</em> [^lahiriNote] predicates, <em>if</em>-questions seem, more-or-less, to be in free variation with <em>whether</em>-questions.</p>
<p>(@3) Jeff {wondered|asked} {if|whether} Britta is taking this class.</p>
<p>Elsewhere however, the similarity between <em>whether</em>-questions and <em>if</em>-questions breaks down. Unlike <em>whether</em>-questions (and interestingly, much like <em>that</em>-clauses), <em>if</em>-questions aren't permitted as the complement of a preposition.</p>
<p>(@5) Britta thought about {whether|<em>if|</em>that} she should attend class.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>if</em>-questions generally seem pretty bad as subjects, unlike both <em>whether</em>-questions and <em>that</em>-clauses, which are attested, under certain conditions, in this environment.</p>
<p>(@6) {Whether|*if} Jeff attends depends on whether Britta attends. (@7) That Britta is attending class worries Jeff.</p>
<p>These facts are clearly telling us something interesting about the syntactic properties of <em>if</em>-questions vis a vis other varieties of embedded clause, maybe specifically about their case properties. I don't want to speculate more about this here.</p>
<p>Moving on, <em>if</em>-questions show some extremely interesting behaviour under <em>responsive</em> predicates, such as <em>know</em> and <em>admit</em>. These facts were first uncovered and analysed in a 2001 paper by @adger<em>syntax</em>2001[^paywallNote], who claim that <em>if</em>-questions exhibit polarity sensitivity under responsive predicates. The judgements are subtle, but the following contrast is fairly illustrative.[^AQNote]</p>
<p>(@8a) *?Jeff told me if Britta left. (@8b) Jeff didn't tell me if Britta left.</p>
<p>Adger &amp; Quer develop a theory tailored to derive this kind of contrast. I have some issues with their account, but I'll leave that for another post (maybe!). For the time being I just want to note that the predicate <em>imagine</em> poses an interesting problem for the distribution of <em>if</em>-clauses, and its certainly outside of the scope of Adger &amp; Quer's account. First, note that <em>imagine</em> doesn't embed <em>whether</em>-questions at all (9). The polarity of the matrix clause doesn't seem to make a difference (10). However, when the matrix clause is an imperative (11), or otherwise a request directed at the addressee (12), an embedded <em>if</em>-question is licensed, despite the fact that an embedded <em>whether</em>-question still isn't.</p>
<p>(@9) Jeff imagined {<em>whether|</em>if|that} Britta left. (@10) Jeff never imagined {<em>whether|</em>if|that} Britta left. (@11) Imagine {<em>whether|if|that} Britta left. (@12) Can you imagine {</em>whether|if|that} Britta left.</p>
<p>Adger &amp; Quer of course don't consider this kind of data, but it's difficult to see how one could extend their account to this, since as far as I can see, they predict <em>if</em>-questions to be licensed in a subset of the environments that <em>whether</em>-questions are.</p>
<p>Zooming out a bit, how the hell do kids acquire these kinds of subtle distributional facts, given that <em>whether</em>-questions and <em>if</em>-questions seem, roughly, to mean the same thing?</p>
<p>More selectional puzzles soon! And, as always, my deepest apologies to the non-linguists.</p>
