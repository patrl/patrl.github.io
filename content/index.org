* About me  

I'm a formal semanticist, which means that I spend most of my time developing precise models of how we construct meanings. Some of my other interests include syntax (especially categorical approaches), functional programming, and category theory. I currently work as lecturer in semantics/pragmatics at the Heinrich-Heine University of DÃ¼sseldorf.
