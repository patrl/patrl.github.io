* About me  

I'm a formal semanticist, which means that I spend most of my time developing precise models of how we construct meanings. I'm currently [[https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/pdell/][a visiting faculty member in the linguistics & philosophy department at MIT]], and will be a lecturer at the Heinrich-Heine University of DÃ¼sseldorf from Fall 2022.
