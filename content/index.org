* About me  

I'm a formal semanticist, which means that my work involves developing models of how we slot meanings together to determine the information conveyed by a sentence, using tools from logic and computer science. I'm currently [[https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/pdell/][a visiting faculty member in the linguistics & philosophy department at MIT]].
