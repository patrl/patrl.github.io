* About me  

I'm currently [[https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/pdell/][a visiting faculty member in the linguistics & philosophy department at MIT]].

I'm a theoretical linguist, which means that my work involves developing formal models of what we know when we know a language. Mostly, I work on semantics and pragmatics; I'm also interested in computational approaches to meaning and the syntax-semantics interface.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I code, run, and scale vertical walls. Reach me at [[mailto:patrick.d.elliott@gmail.com][patrick.d.elliott@gmail.com]].
