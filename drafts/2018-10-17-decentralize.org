* Publishing on the decentralised web

[[https://dat-project.org][Dat]] and [[https://ipfs.io][IPFS]] are two relatively young protocols at the heart of the so-called
/decentralized web/ (see also: /distributed web/, /immutable web/, /permanent
web/, etc.). The decentralization movement, broadly construed, aims to free us
from the shackles of the traditional client/server architecture by marshalling
contemporary peer-to-peer technologies. In other words, the aim is to develop an
alternative to huge cloud-based companies like google and facebook, and return
power and control over information to the user. In theory, the decentralised web
means that information can live on even if servers come and go -- /everyone/ is
a node.

Dat and IPFS (which stands for Inter-Planetary File System) have relatively similar aims -- they both provide a protocol and tooling for
sharing content-addressable information between peers, with no single point of failure. Dat was originally developed as a means for
scientists to share large datasets, but the ecosystem has however grown quite a bit beyond this
initial remit -- see, e.g., [[https://beakerbrowser.com/][the Beaker Browser]]. IPFS on the other hand was
pretty much always intended as a distributed alternative to the web, and there's
already an [[https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion][extension]] to integrate modern browsers with the IPFS protocol. There
are of course other technologies on the scene, such as [[https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/][scuttlebutt]] (which I'll
probably write about some other time), and Tim Berners-Lee's new [[https://solid.mit.edu/][solid]] platform,
but for now dat and IPFS seem the most mature and usable.

In what follows, I'll explain how I publish my [[https://patrickdelliott.com][homepage]] -- a static site built with
[[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][hakyll]] and [[github:patrl/patrl.github.io][hosted on github]] -- via IPFS at [[ipns/patrickdelliott.com]] and dat at [[dat://patrl.hashbase.io]]. There wasn't any real necessity to publish this site on the decentralized web --
after all, the number of users who are going to visit this page via dat/ipfs is
probably vanishingly small -- but I thought it would be a fun (and very nerdy)
experiment, and an opportunity to learn a little more about these emerging
technologies, which I think are independently quite exciting.

** IPFS

*** Running an IPFS node locally

Before doing anything else, I needed to install ipfs, initialize the repository,
and start the ipfs daemon. On the off-chance you happen to be another NixOS
user, this is as simple as adding the following line to your
~configuration.nix~!

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
services.enable.ifps = true;
#+END_SRC

Otherwise, you can follow the instructions [[https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage][here]]. After starting the ipfs daemon,
you can check whether or not you're connected to the network by running ~ipfs
swarm peers~, which should return the ipfs addresses of your peers.

*** Publishing on IPFS

First, we retrieve the peer ID of the local ipfs node:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
peerid=$(ipfs id -f"<id>")
#+END_SRC

On my local machine, my website, built by hakyll, can be found at
~~GitHub/patrl.github.io/_site/~. I ran the
following, which adds the website to IPFS and retrieves the hash of the directory root:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
siteloc=~/GitHub/patrl.github.io/_site
dirhash=$(ipfs add -r $(siteloc)/ | grep $(siteloc)$ | cut -d" " -f2)
#+END_SRC

Finally, we publish the directory to our nodes ~ipns~ entry:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ipfs name publish $dirhash
#+END_SRC

*** IPFS redirect

** Dat

Before talking about dat, a little background: what got me started with this
whole endeavour was an (in hindsight, overly ambitious) attempt to migrate this
site from gh-pages pages to a personal web server, and publish to both
[[https://patrickdelliott.com]] and [[dat://patrickdelliott.com]]
via [[https://github.com/beakerbrowser/homebase][homebase]]. I managed to get this working after jumping through quite a few
hoops, but found that homebase wouldn't reliably sync with my website's dat
repository, and the whole setup required too much manual intervention to be
really worthwhile. I'll take another look at homebase once it's a bit more mature.
