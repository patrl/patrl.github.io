## Research Themes

- Broad interests: linguistic theory, syntax, semantics, the interfaces, pragmatics, philosophy of language

* Specific interests:
    + Division of labour between syntax and semantics in linguistic theory generally.
    + Syntax and semantics of clausal embedding.
    + Syntactic and semantic constraints on scope-taking.
    + Conditions under which linguistic material can go missing ("ellipsis").
    + The interpretation of questions.
