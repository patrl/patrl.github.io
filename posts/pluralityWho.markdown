I've been thinking a little about the meaning of *wh*-expressions in English recently. When you really start digging, it looks like these expressions might tell us something interesting about how the meaning of plurality, and how this interacts with the expression of plurality in the actual morphology of the language. 

## Why is "who" interesting?

Let's begin by contrasting *who* with other expressions we can use to form questions about individuals, such as *which teacher*. By the way, I'll be referring to expressions like *who* as *simplex wh-expressions*, and expressions like *which teacher* as (intuitively enough) *which-phrases*. An intuitive idea about the meaning difference between the two goes as follows: *which teacher* is used to form questions about individuals that are *teachers*, whereas *who* is used to form questions about inividuals that are *people*. That is to say, since *teachers* are a subset of *people*, *which-*phrases are typically used to ask more specific questions than simplex *wh-*expressions.

It turns out, there's a little more to say than that. Consider the questions (1) and (2). It's possible to answer either/or by saying "Shirley left the party", only, in the latter case the assumption is that *Shirley* is a teacher. Things get a little more interesting if we consider what happens if we're in a context where multiple people have left the party. In this instance, it's possible to answer (1) by saying "Shirley and Britta left the party", but this sounds super weird as an answer to (2).

1. Who left the party?
2. Which teacher left the party?

Nothing in our intuitive account of the meaning difference between *who* and *which teacher* seems to clue us into what's happening here. It turns out though that there's at least one promising account of why (2) sounds weird in a scenario where multiple teachers left the party, which brings us to...

## Dayal (1996)
<section>
<p>
Veneeta Dayal, in her 1996 book *Locality in WH Quantification*, developed an influential theory of the meaning of questions, one aspect of which explains the puzzling restriction we noted on (2). Dayal's account, informally, goes something like this: 
</p>
<p>
- the meaning of a question is the set of possible answers, so the meaning of (2) is defined as the set of propositions of the form *x left the party*, where *x* is a teacher. It's important to note here that since *teacher* is morphologically singular (cf. *teachers*), only propositions like *Shirley left the party* will be members of this set. *Shirley and Annie left the party* will never be in this set, since *Shirley and Annie* are a group of teachers, rather than a teacher singular.
- When I ask a question, I assume that there is a single best answer than can be given. In other words, there is a unique answer that is both *true*, and *maximally informative*. We can state this slightly more formally by saying that asking a question presupposes that the set mentioned in the previous point has a unique, true, maximally informative members.
</p>
<p>
With these two pieces in place, we can explain why (2) sounds weird in a scenario where multiple teachers left the party. This is because the meaning of (2) is the set of answers of the form *x left the party*. If, in actual fact, Shirley and Annie left the party, then there will be two true members of this set: the answer *Shirley left the party*, and the answer *Annie left the party*. Neither is more informative than the other, and both are true, so the presupposition that the question has a unique, maximally informative true answer cannot be met. In fact, it can only be met in a circumstance where a single teacher left the party, which is exactly what we find.

## The puzzle

The problem now is if we apply this same reasoning to (1), shouldn't we expect that it should sound weird in a scenario where multiple people met the party?  Aha, but maybe unlike *which teacher*, *who* is plural, i.e., it can be used to ask questions about groups of people. There are a couple of reasons to be suspicious about this idea.

Although we can't see whether *who* is singular or plural on the surface, we can tell by looking at the agreement it triggers on the verb.

3. Which teacher **has** already left?
4. Which teachers **have** already left?
5. Who **has** already left?
6. \*Who **have** already left?

Interestingly, *who* triggers singular agreement on the verb. Dayal, of course, notices this, and speculates that *who* is semantically plural yet morphosyntactically singular. As a brief aside, there are another class of expressions in English which have been described in this way -- so-called *committee NPs*, such as (the eponymous) noun *committee*, *team*, *panel*, etc. Much like *who*, committee NPs trigger singular agreement, but there are clear signs that they are semantically plural. For example, committee NPs can be predicated of *collective predicates* -- predicates which normally disallow singular subjects, as indicated below.

7. The teacher has met already. ❌
8. The teachers have met already. ✓
9. The committee **has** met already. ✓

### Absence of anti-singleton inference

If *who* is semantically plural, the question is -- why doesn't it give rise to an anti-singleton inference, like other semantically plural expressions?

10. Which teachers have left already?
    a. Shirley has left already. ❌
    b. Shirley and Annie have left already. ✓
    
11. Who has left already?
    a. Shirley has left already. ✓
    b. Shirley and Annie have left already. ✓
