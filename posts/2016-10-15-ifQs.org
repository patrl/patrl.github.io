* A note on /if/-questions

/If/-clauses are weird. They have a couple of prominent uses: as the
antecedent clause in a conditional /if...then.../ statement (see (1)),
and as an embedded question (2).

1) If Britta is taking this class, then I'm not.
2) Jeff asked if Britta is taking this class.

Here, I'm interested in the latter cases, which I'll call
/if/-questions. Their distribution is constrained in some interesting
ways. Under /rogative/ [fn:1] predicates, /if/-questions seem,
more-or-less, to be in free variation with /whether/-questions.

3) Jeff {wondered|asked} {if|whether} Britta is taking this class.

Elsewhere however, the similarity between /whether/-questions and
/if/-questions breaks down. Unlike /whether/-questions (and
interestingly, much like /that/-clauses), /if/-questions aren't
permitted as the complement of a preposition.

4) Britta thought about {whether|if|that} she should attend class.

Furthermore, /if/-questions generally seem pretty bad as subjects,
unlike both /whether/-questions and /that/-clauses, which are attested,
under certain conditions, in this environment.

5) {Whether|*if} Jeff attends depends on whether Britta attends.
6) That Britta is attending class worries Jeff.

These facts are clearly telling us something interesting about the
syntactic properties of /if/-questions vis a vis other varieties of
embedded clause, maybe specifically about their case properties. I don't
want to speculate more about this here.

Moving on, /if/-questions show some extremely interesting behaviour
under /responsive/ predicates, such as /know/ and /admit/. These facts
were first uncovered and analysed in a 2001 paper by
@adger_syntax_2001[fn:2], who claim that /if/-questions exhibit
polarity sensitivity under responsive predicates. The judgements are
subtle, but the following contrast is fairly illustrative.[fn:3]

7) *?Jeff told me if Britta left.
8) Jeff didn't tell me if Britta left.

Adger & Quer develop a theory tailored to derive this kind of contrast.
I have some issues with their account, but I'll leave that for another
post (maybe!). For the time being I just want to note that the predicate
/imagine/ poses an interesting problem for the distribution of
/if/-clauses, and its certainly outside of the scope of Adger & Quer's
account. First, note that /imagine/ doesn't embed /whether/-questions at
all (9). The polarity of the matrix clause doesn't seem to make a
difference (10). However, when the matrix clause is an imperative (11),
or otherwise a request directed at the addressee (12), an embedded
/if/-question is licensed, despite the fact that an embedded
/whether/-question still isn't.

9)  Jeff imagined {whether|if|that} Britta left.
10) Jeff never imagined {whether|if|that} Britta left.
11) Imagine {*whether|if|that} Britta left.
12) Can you imagine {*whether|if|that} Britta left.

Adger & Quer of course don't consider this kind of data, but it's
difficult to see how one could extend their account to this, since as
far as I can see, they predict /if/-questions to be licensed in a subset
of the environments that /whether/-questions are.

Zooming out a bit, how the hell do kids acquire these kinds of subtle
distributional facts, given that /whether/-questions and /if/-questions
seem, roughly, to mean the same thing?

More selectional puzzles soon! And, as always, my deepest apologies to
the non-linguists.

[fn:1] cite:heimThesis classifies predicates that embed
       questions, broadly, as either /rogative/ or /responsive/.
       /Rogative/ predicates are those which may embed interrogative
       clauses, but not declaratives, like /wonder/ and /ask/.
       /Responsive/ predicates on the other hand may embed both
       interrogatives and declaratives, such as /know/ and /tell/.

[fn:3] This isn't much discussed much by cite:adger_syntax_2001, but (8a)
       is almost certainly acceptable under the reading that can be
       paraphrased as "If Britta left, then Jeff told me (that Britta
       left)". I assume that this is a possible analysis of (8a), since
       /tell/ independently allows Null Complement Anaphora, as in
       "Britta left. Jeff told me."
