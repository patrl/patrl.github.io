I'm a final year PhD candidate in <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics">the Linguistics department at UCL</a>; I'm a theoretical linguist, which means that my work involves developing formal models of what we know when we know a language. Mostly, I do semantics, but I'm also interested in syntax, morphology, pragmatics, and their interfaces with semantics. 

When I'm not doing linguistics, I <a href="https://github.com/patrl">code</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59694544-patrick-elliott">read</a>, and scale vertical walls. I'm a very slow writer but really good at poaching eggs.
